                prevent the spread of heretical recipes – part of his life-long war on witchcraft.</figcaption>

            <h2>Here’s a time line of Aurelius’ life:</h2>
            <li>1472 – Born in Toledo, Castile</li>
            <li>1487 – Joins the Order of the Holy Flame at age 15 after mistakenly setting his schoolyard on fire
                during a “witch-detector” experiment</li>
            <li>1493 – Studies under Cardinal Montemayor, who teaches him that suspicious hats are often the first sign
                of sorcery</li>
            <li>1499 – Writes his first treatise On the Dangerous Properties of Broomsticks</li>
            <li>1502 – Leads his first public lecture on the prophylaxis of witchcraft; insists that garlic necklaces
                and regular hymn-singing protect the soul</li>
            <li>1507 – Appointed Junior Inquisitor after successfully proving that a suspicious goat was merely a goat
            </li>
            <li>1515 – Develops the “Holy Checklist of Thirteen Signs of Heresy,” still copied by village clerks across
                Castile</li>
            <li>1521 – Survives the infamous “Soup Cauldron Panic,” when an entire town believed stew was cursed.
                Aurelius heroically tasted it first, declaring it “only slightly salty”</li>
            <li>1530 – Becomes Grand Inquisitor, expands his doctrine that prevention is better than persecution:
                “Better to sprinkle holy water on your neighbor’s laundry than to burn their house”</li>
            <li>1545 – Publishes The Everyday Manual of Anti-Witchcraft Hygiene, including advice on cleaning brooms,
                polishing cauldrons, and keeping suspicious cats indoors at night</li>
            <li>1552 – Awarded the Golden Censer of Virtue for reducing witchcraft accusations in his diocese by 73%
                through education and preventive measures</li>
            <li>1560 – Declares that laughter is the best counter-spell, institutes weekly Comedy Sermons to disarm fear
                of sorcery</li>
            <li>1567 – Dies at the age of 95, reportedly after blessing an entire vineyard against grape-demons.</li>
